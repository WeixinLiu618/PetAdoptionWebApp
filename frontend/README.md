## Overview
This project displays animals that need a home and a new owner and provides the respectful data of these animals such as names, sex, age, breed, health, photos. 

A list of pets cards are shown in our website by clicking navbar `pets`--`All Pets` or by clicking link of `Meet more` card.   
Users can also filter the pets by their species, like dog, by clicking navbar `pets`--`Dog` or by clicking dog species card of Home page.
By clicking in `View Details` on each pet card, users can view the details for each pet.

And our website presents some famous organizations for pets rescue in the `Shelters` page. If interested, users can check more information with the external link on each shelter card and filter the shelters cards by location.

We implemented `Register` and `Signin` functions for users. And after signing in, users can add pets to their favorite list, and view their favorite pets in the `Favorite` component.

If a user is a foster and want to find a adoptor for a pet, we provide a form on `I am a foster...` page. This component currently is only a frontend element and need to be improved. And maybe later we can develop a management system for reviewing the submitted data and publishing the reviewed infomation to the front desk.
